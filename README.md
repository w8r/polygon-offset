# Offset [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/polygon-offset.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/polygon-offset) [![TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/w8r/polygon-offset.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/w8r/polygon-offset)

Small lib for polygon offsetting(margin/padding). See the [example](http://w8r.github.io/polygon-offset) of how it can be used with [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com). It handles quite well oddly shaped and concave polygons.

The reason I wrote this is that the only working solution to this problem known to me is Angus Johnson's [Clipper](http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php) library. Library is huge and offsetting in it is subroutine.

This library depends on [Martinez](http://github.com/w8r/martinez/) polygon clipping algorithm, and combined with it weighs ~14kb.

## Install

Node

```bash
$ npm install polygon-offset
```

Browserify
```js
var Offset = require('polygon-offset');
```

Browser

```html
<script src="path/to/offset.min.js"></script>
```

## Use

```js
// if the first point repeats(for instance GeoJSON) -
// the output will have it as well
var points = [
  [0,0], [0,100],
  [100,100], [100,0], [0,0]
];
var x = -10;

var offset = new Offset();
var margined = offset.data(points).margin(10);
var padding = offset.data(points).padding(10);

// decides from the sign of x: negative for padding
var unknown = offset.data(points).arcSegments(3).offset(x);

// if you want to work with the polyline - margin only
var polyline = offset.data(points).offsetLine(5);

```

Result will be array of linear rings.

## Dependencies

[Martinez](https://github.com/w8r/martinez/) clipping algorithm

## Development

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ open http://localhost:3003
$ make
$ npm test
```

Build

To compile the lib with Google Closure Compiler with `ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS`

```bash
$ make
```
